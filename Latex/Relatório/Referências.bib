abstract = {Citizen-science programs are often touted as useful for advancing conservation literacy, scientific knowledge, and increasing scientific-reasoning skills among the public. Guidelines for collaboration among scientists and the public are lacking and the extent to which these citizen-science initiatives change behavior is relatively unstudied. Over two years, we studied 82 participants in a three-day program that included education about non-native invasive plants and collection of data on the occurrence of those plants. Volunteers were given background knowledge about invasive plant ecology and trained on a specific protocol for collecting invasive plant data. They then collected data and later gathered as a group to analyze data and discuss responsible environmental behavior with respect to invasive plants. We tested whether participants without experience in plant identification and with little knowledge of invasive plants increased their knowledge of invasive species ecology, participation increased knowledge of scientific methods, and participation affected behavior. Knowledge of invasive plants increased on average 24{\%}, but participation was insufficient to increase understanding of how scientific research is conducted. Participants reported increased ability to recognize invasive plants and increased awareness of effects of invasive plants on the environment, but this translated into little change in behavior regarding invasive plants. Potential conflicts between scientific goals, educational goals, and the motivation of participants must be considered during program design. {\textcopyright} 2011 Society for Conservation Biology.},

abstract = {Citizen science programs are touted as useful tools for engaging the public in science and for collecting important data for scientists and resource managers. To accomplish the latter, it must be shown that data collected by volunteers is sufficiently accurate and reliable. We engaged 119 volunteers over three years to map and estimate abundance of invasive plants in New York and New Jersey parklands. We tested their accuracy via collected pressed samples and by subsampling their transect points. We also compared the performances of volunteers and botanical experts. Our results support the notion that volunteer participation can enhance the data generated by scientists alone. We found that the quality of data collected might be affected by the environment in which the data are collected. We suggest that giving consideration to how people learn can not only help to achieve educational goals but can also help to produce more data to be used in scientific study. {\textcopyright} 2011 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.},

abstract = {Citizen science may be especially effective in urban landscapes due to the large pool of potential volunteers. However, there have been few evaluations of the contributions of citizen scientists to knowledge of biological communities in and around cities. To assess the effectiveness of citizen scientists' monitoring of species in urban areas, we compared butterfly data collected over 10 years in Chicago, Illinois (U.S.A.), and New York City, New York (U.S.A.). The dates, locations, and methods of data collection in Chicago were standardized, whereas data from New York were collected at any location at any time. For each city, we evaluated whether the number of observers, observation days (days on which observations were reported), and sampling locations were associated with the reported proportion of the estimated regional pool of butterfly species. We also compared the number of volunteers, duration of volunteer involvement, and consistency of sampling efforts at individual locations within each city over time. From 2001 to 2010, there were 73 volunteers in Chicago and 89 in New York. During this period, volunteers observed 86{\%} and 89{\%} of the estimated number of butterfly species present in Chicago and New York, respectively. Volunteers in New York reported a greater proportion of the estimated pool of butterfly species per year. In addition, more species were observed per volunteer and observation day in New York, largely due to the unrestricted sampling season in New York. Chicago volunteers were active for more years and monitored individual locations more consistently over time than volunteers in New York. Differences in monitoring protocol-especially length of sampling season and selection protocol for monitoring locations-influenced the relationship between species accrual and sampling effort, which suggests these factors are important in volunteer-based species-monitoring programs. {\textcopyright} 2012 Society for Conservation Biology.},

Building on the social movement participation model, findings from a longitudinal empirical study in three different citizen science projects reveal that quantity of contribution is determined by collective motives, norm-oriented motives, reputation, and intrinsic motives. Contribution quality, on the other hand, is positively affected only by collective motives and reputation.

However, the reliability of datasets collected by these initiatives often remains poorly quantified. We compared datasets of shark counts collected by professional dive guides with acoustic telemetry data from tagged sharks collected at the same coral reef sites over a period of five years. There was a strong correlation between the number of grey reef sharks (Carcharhinus amblyrhynchos) observed by dive guides and the telemetry data at both daily and monthly intervals, suggesting that variation in relative abundance of sharks was detectable in datasets collected by dive guides in a similar manner to data derived from telemetry at these time scales. There was no correlation between the number or mean depth of sharks recorded by telemetry and the presence of tourist divers, suggesting that the behaviour of sharks was not affected by the presence of divers during our study. Data recorded by dive guides showed that current strength and temperature were important drivers of the relative abundance of sharks at monitored sites. Our study validates the use of datasets of shark abundance collected by professional dive guides in frequently-visited dive sites in Palau, and supports the participation of experienced recreational divers as contributors to long-term monitoring programs of shark populations. {\textcopyright} 2014 Vianna et al.},

abstract = {Scientific research performed with the involvement of the broader public (the crowd) attracts increasing attention from scientists and policy makers. A key premise is that project organizers may be able to draw on underused human resources to advance research at relatively low cost. Despite a growing number of examples, systematic research on the effort contributions volunteers are willing to make to crowd science projects is lacking. Analyzing data on seven different projects, we quantify the financial value volunteers can bring by comparing their unpaid contributions with counterfactual costs in traditional or online labor markets. The volume of total contributions is substantial, although some projects are much more successful in attracting effort than others. Moreover, contributions received by projects are very uneven across time-a tendency toward declining activity is interrupted by spikes typically resulting from outreach efforts or media attention. Analyzing user-level data, we find that most contributors participate only once and with little effort, leaving a relatively small share of users who return responsible for most of the work. Although top contributor status is earned primarily through higher levels of effort, top contributors also tend to work faster. This speed advantage develops over multiple sessions, suggesting that it reflects learning rather than inherent differences in skills. Our findings inform recent discussions about potential benefits from crowd science, suggest that involving the crowd may be more effective for some kinds of projects than others, provide guidance for project managers, and raise important questions for future research.},

abstract = {The identification of impact craters on planetary surfaces provides important information about their geological history. Most studies have relied on individual analysts who map and identify craters and interpret crater statistics. However, little work has been done to determine how the counts vary as a function of technique, terrain, or between researchers. Furthermore, several novel internet-based projects ask volunteers with little to no training to identify craters, and it was unclear how their results compare against the typical professional researcher. To better understand the variation among experts and to compare with volunteers, eight professional researchers have identified impact features in two separate regions of the Moon. Small craters (diameters ranging from 10. m to 500. m) were measured on a lunar mare region and larger craters (100s m to a few km in diameter) were measured on both lunar highlands and maria. Volunteer data were collected for the small craters on the mare. Our comparison shows that the level of agreement among experts depends on crater diameter, number of craters per diameter bin, and terrain type, with differences of up to {\~{}}±45{\%}. We also found artifacts near the minimum crater diameter that was studied. These results indicate that caution must be used in most cases when interpreting small variations in crater size-frequency distributions and for craters ≲10. pixels across. Because of the natural variability found, projects that emphasize many people identifying craters on the same area and using a consensus result are likely to yield the most consistent and robust information. {\textcopyright} 2014 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract = {A typical way to quantify aboveground carbon in forests is to measure tree diameters and use species-specific allometric equations to estimate biomass and carbon stocks. Using "citizen scientists" to collect data that are usually time-consuming and labor-intensive can play a valuable role in ecological research. However, data validation, such as establishing the sampling error in volunteer measurements, is a crucial, but little studied, part of utilizing citizen science data. The aims of this study were to (1) evaluate the quality of tree diameter and height measurements carried out by volunteers compared to expert scientists and (2) estimate how sensitive carbon stock estimates are to these measurement sampling errors. Using all diameter data measured with a diameter tape, the volunteer mean sampling error (difference between repeated measurements of the same stem) was 9.9 mm, and the expert sampling error was 1.8 mm. Excluding those sampling errors {\textgreater}1 cm, the mean sampling errors were 2.3 mm (volunteers) and 1.4 mm (experts) (this excluded 14{\%} [volunteer] and 3{\%} [expert] of the data). The sampling error in diameter measurements had a small effect on the biomass estimates of the plots: a volunteer (expert) diameter sampling error of 2.3 mm (1.4 mm) translated into 1.7{\%} (0.9{\%}) change in the biomass estimates calculated from species-specific allometric equations based upon diameter. Height sampling error had a dependent relationship with tree height. Including height measurements in biomass calculations compounded the sampling error markedly; the impact of volunteer sampling error on biomass estimates was 615{\%}, and the expert range was 69{\%}. Using dendrometer bands, used to measure growth rates, we calculated that the volunteer (vs. expert) sampling error was 0.6 mm (vs. 0.3 mm), which is equivalent to a difference in carbon storage of ±0.011 kg C/yr (vs. ±0.002 kg C/yr) per stem. Using a citizen science model for monitoring carbon stocks not only has benefits in educating and engaging the public in science, but as demonstrated here, can also provide accurate estimates of biomass or forest carbon stocks. {\textcopyright} 2013 by the Ecological Society of America.},

abstract = {Systematic monitoring of species across their geographic ranges is a critical part of conservation but it is resource-intensive, costly, and difficult to organize and maintain in the long-term. Large-scale community science programs like eBird may improve our ability to monitor bird populations, particularly in tropical regions where formal studies are lacking. Here, we estimated population trends for nearly 9000 bird species using global eBird birdwatching data and compared our trends to the population trends designated by BirdLife International. We calculated the rate of agreement between eBird and BirdLife trends and examined the effects of latitudinal affiliation, threat status, number of eBird checklists, eBird trend, BirdLife trend and BirdLife trend derivation on the rate of agreement. We also used a randomization approach to compare observed rates of agreement with the rates of agreement expected by chance alone. We show that the rate of agreement was marginally better than expected by chance and improved significantly for temperate region species of Least Concern with more checklists, and species that eBird or BirdLife identified as increasing. Our results suggest that eBird data are not currently adequate for monitoring populations of the majority of the world's bird species, especially in the developing world where systematic surveys are essential. Increased local participation in community science initiatives like eBird may improve our ability to effectively monitor species. Furthermore, it is important to assess the accuracy of BirdLife trends and the manner in which they are derived, especially for species where BirdLife and eBird data trends disagree.},

abstract = {Urban wildlife populations present different scenarios for managers compared to rural populations, partly because of greater diversity in stakeholder attitudes and opinions regarding urban wildlife. Wild urban canids—especially coyotes (Canis latrans)—have been of increasing interest throughout North America in recent years. Our objective was to evaluate the potential of using iNaturalist-generated observations of urban red foxes and coyotes for cost-effective, customizable data collection to inform urban canid management. Our research is important on two fronts; first, it is a way to engage the public to make them more aware of urban canids, and secondly, it is an attempt to empirically test if we can more efficiently and effectively track coyotes and red foxes in urban areas. We used iNaturalist to collect over 800 community-generated locations for red foxes (Vulpes vulpes) and coyotes in Madison, WI from 2015 and 2016. We concurrently placed radio-collars on 11 red foxes and 11 coyotes to determine areas used in this urban ecosystem. We compared iNaturalist to radio-telemetry locations to identify factors that led to a positive relationship between these two inherently different spatial data sets. Greatest overlap between iNaturalist and telemetry data for both red foxes and coyotes occurred in areas with moderate human development and there was minimal overlap in natural areas. The overlap between iNaturalist and telemetry locations was comparable for both species, but the underlying mechanism differed by species-specific habitat use. iNaturalist reports appeared to show where and when humans most often interacted with red foxes and coyotes, rather than their true spatiotemporal distribution. Understanding the relationship between community-generated reports and local canid distribution may inform how iNaturalist can be used as a management tool and allow managers to proactively monitor and manage human-wildlife interactions with urban wildlife.},

This study presents actions taken in a citizen science program to assure data quality and demonstrates the validity of citizen-generated data. In this case the accuracy of data collected by secondary school students as citizens in a program that quantitatively sampled benthic rocky intertidal communities at 13 sites on Maui, Molokai, Oahu, and Hawai'i island during the years 2004-2007 was evaluated. In 2007, two independent research teams collected data simultaneously with students at five sites on eight sampling dates. Comparisons of Shannon diversity and Bray-Curtis similarity values computed and simulated from student and researcher collected datarevealed that nonexpert students accurately collectcommunity- level data withinthe range of the variation that occurs between researchers. Students were, however, likely to misidentify cryptic and rare species. These findings have direct implications for the conservation goals of the monitoring program as the assessment reveals that students are likely to misidentify early alien introductions but are able to monitor the abundances of native and introduced species once they become established. The validity assessment designed for this investigation is unique in that itdirectly compares consistent errors made bycitizensindata collectionto expert variability to identify usage limitations and can be a guide for future studies that involve the efforts of trained volunteers. {\textcopyright} 2012 by the Ecological Society of America.},

abstract = {Citizen science enlists the public in collecting large quantities of data across an array of habitats and locations over long spans of time. Citizen science projects have been remarkably successful in advancing scientific knowledge, and contributions from citizen scientists now provide a vast quantity of data about species occurrence and distribution around the world. Most citizen science projects also strive to help participants learn about the organisms they are observing and to experience the process by which scientific investigations are conducted. Developing and implementing public data-collection projects that yield both scientific and educational outcomes requires significant effort. This article describes the model for building and operating citizen science projects that has evolved at the Cornell Lab of Ornithology over the past two decades. We hope that our model will inform the fields of biodiversity monitoring, biological research, and science education while providing a window into the culture of citizen science. {\textcopyright} 2009 by American Institute of Biological Sciences.

abstract = {Citizen-science projects engage volunteers to gather or process data to address scientific questions. But citizen-science projects vary in their ability to contribute usefully for science, conservation, or public policy. eBird has evolved from a basic citizen-science project into a collective enterprise, taking a novel approach to citizen science by developing cooperative partnerships among experts in a wide range of fields: population and distributions, conservation biologists, quantitative ecologists, statisticians, computer scientists, GIS and informatics specialists, application developers, and data administrators. The goal is to increase data quantity through participant recruitment and engagement, but also to quantify and control for data quality issues such as observer variability, imperfect detection of species, and both spatial and temporal bias in data collection. Advances at the interface among ecology, statistics, and computer science allow us to create new species distribution models that provide accurate estimates across broad spatial and temporal scales with extremely detailed resolution. eBird data are openly available and used by a broad spectrum of students, teachers, scientists, NGOs, government agencies, land managers, and policy makers. Feedback from this broad data use community helps identify development priorities. As a result, eBird has become a major source of biodiversity data, increasing our knowledge of the dynamics of species distributions, and having a direct impact on the conservation of birds and their habitats. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {Four different types of fuel blends containing demolition and construction wood and household waste were combusted in a small-scale experimental set-up to study the effect of fuel composition on the emissions of polychlorinated dibenzo-p-dioxins (PCDDs), dibenzofurans (PCDFs), biphenyls (PCBs), chlorobenzenes (PCBzs), chlorophenols (PCPhs) and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs). Two woody materials, commercial stemwood (ST) and demolition and construction wood (DC) were selected because of the differences in their persistent organic pollutants (POPs), ash and metals content. For household waste, we used a municipal solid waste (MSW) and a refuse-derived fuel (RDF) from MSW with 5–20 wt{\%} and up to 5 wt{\%} food waste content respectively. No clear effect on the formation of pollutants was observed with different food waste content in the fuel blends tested. Combustion of ST-based fuels was very inefficient which led to high PAH emissions (32 ± 3.8 mg/kgfuel). The use of DC clearly increased the total PCDD and PCDF emissions (71 ± 26 $\mu$g/kgfuel) and had a clear effect on the formation of toxic congeners (210 ± 87 ng WHO2005-TEQ/kgfuel). The high PCDD and PCDF emissions from DC-based fuels can be attributed to the presence of material contaminants such as small pieces of metals or plastics as well as timber treated with chromated copper arsenate preservatives and pentachlorophenol in the DC source.},

These records are composed of skins and other evidence collected and deposited in collections, and on photographs and voice samples. A total of 793 species were registered, distributed in 25 orders and 85 families, and corresponding to 45{\%} of the Brazilian avifauna. Reasons for this high diversity are related to the environmental diversity found in the state, influenced by altitudinal and geographical ranges, different phytophysiognomies, presence of a coastal region, and areas of contact between forest ecosystems and Cerrado. Results of the Biota project contributed to a better understanding of how birds respond to anthropogenic alterations of the environment, such as habitat fragmentation. The main ornithological research groups are still based in universities and museums. Deficiencies of knowledge concerning bird studies in S{\~{a}}o Paulo are related to the lack of standardization of survey methodologies; paucity in the monitoring of threatened species in the long term; restricted knowledge about species capacity to use matrix; and lack of refinement in the delimitation of evolutionary units and their distribution, which is essential for species reintroduction in regions where they have gone extinct.},

abstract = {One of the world's largest citizen science projects is eBird, a database that has been used primarily to address questions of bird distributions and abundance over large spatial scales. However, addressing finer-scale questions is also possible, depending on survey coverage and whether assumptions and limitations are matched to the scale of inferences. Our objective was to determine if the eBird database could be used to develop estimates of bird abundance and diversity comparable to those from standardized shorebird surveys. We compared a year of standardized shorebird surveys by trained observers at Snook Islands Natural Area located in Palm Beach County, Florida, to a year of eBird observations from the same site. Total species richness derived from eBird (25 species) was higher than that from standardized surveys (20 species). Similarly, we found the Shannon diversity index calculated from eBird was higher (2.81) than the same index calculated from standardized surveys (2.21; P {\textless} 0.001). The higher diversity and species richness may reflect the greater effort of eBird participants (35,289 person-hours) compared to our standard surveys (2126 person-hours). We found only a slight difference in parameter estimates between data obtained from eBird and from standardized surveys. Potential use and value of eBird as a tool for land managers and conservationists may be greater than currently realized, but studies conducted in a wider range of ecosystems and locations are needed to develop generalizations.},

abstract = {Context: The concept of citizen science (CS) is currently referred to by many actors inside and outside science and research. Several descriptions of this purportedly new approach of science are often heard in connection with large datasets and the possibilities of mobilizing crowds outside science to assists with observations and classifications. However, other accounts refer to CS as a way of democratizing science, aiding concerned communities in creating data to influence policy and as a way of promoting political decision processes involving environment and health. Objective: In this study we analyse two datasets (N = 1935, N = 633) retrieved from the Web of Science (WoS) with the aim of giving a scientometric description of what the concept of CS entails. We account for its development over time, and what strands of research that has adopted CS and give an assessment of what scientific output has been achieved in CS-related projects. To attain this, scientometric methods have been combined with qualitative approaches to render more precise search terms. Results: Results indicate that there are three main focal points of CS. The largest is composed of research on biology, conservation and ecology, and utilizes CS mainly as a methodology of collecting and classifying data. A second strand of research has emerged through geographic information research, where citizens participate in the collection of geographic data. Thirdly, there is a line of research relating to the social sciences and epidemiology, which studies and facilitates public participation in relation to environmental issues and health. In terms of scientific output, the largest body of articles are to be found in biology and conservation research. In absolute numbers, the amount of publications generated by CS is low (N = 1935), but over the past decade a new and very productive line of CS based on digital platforms has emerged for the collection and classification of data.},

Herein, we present a completely new and annotated version of our checklist. For the first time, we list all bird subspecies known from Brazil that are currently accepted by at least one key ornithological reference work. The inclusion of the subspecies should be seen as a synthesis, and not as a taxonomic endorsement. As such, we include in the new checklist 1919 avian species, 910 of which are treated as polytypic in reference works (2042 subspecies), totaling 3051 taxa at the species and subspecies level. We anticipate that several of the subspecies included in our list may be subject to future taxonomic upgrades to species status, while others will probably be shown to be invalid in the light of future taxonomic studies. The results highlight Brazil as a megadiverse country and reinforce the need for proper enforcement of political tools, laws and international commitments assumed by the country to preserve its biodiversity.},

abstract = {Predicting the binding mode of flexible polypeptides to proteins is an important task that falls outside the domain of applicability of most small molecule and protein−protein docking tools. Here, we test the small molecule flexible ligand docking program Glide on a set of 19 non-$\alpha$-helical peptides and systematically improve pose prediction accuracy by enhancing Glide sampling for flexible polypeptides. In addition, scoring of the poses was improved by post-processing with physics-based implicit solvent MM- GBSA calculations. Using the best RMSD among the top 10 scoring poses as a metric, the success rate (RMSD ≤ 2.0 {\AA} for the interface backbone atoms) increased from 21{\%} with default Glide SP settings to 58{\%} with the enhanced peptide sampling and scoring protocol in the case of redocking to the native protein structure. This approaches the accuracy of the recently developed Rosetta FlexPepDock method (63{\%} success for these 19 peptides) while being over 100 times faster. Cross-docking was performed for a subset of cases where an unbound receptor structure was available, and in that case, 40{\%} of peptides were docked successfully. We analyze the results and find that the optimized polypeptide protocol is most accurate for extended peptides of limited size and number of formal charges, defining a domain of applicability for this approach.},

abstract = {Data generated by citizen science is particularly valuable in ecological research. If used discerningly with data from traditional scientific references, citizen science can directly contribute to biogeography knowledge and conservation policies by increasing the number of species records in large geographic areas. Considering the current level of knowledge on south Brazilian avifauna, the large volume of data produced by uncoordinated citizen science effort (CS), and the growing need for information on changes in abundance and species composition, we have compiled an updated, general list of bird species occurrence within the state of Parana. We have listed extinct, invasive and recently-colonizing species as well as indicator species of the state's vegetation types. We further assess the degree of knowledge of different regions within the state based on data from traditional scientific references, and the effect of including CS data in the same analysis. We have compiled data on 766 bird species, based on 70, 346 individual records from traditional scientific references, and 79, 468 from CS. Extinct and invasive species were identified by comparing their occurrence and abundance over a series of three time periods. Indicator species analysis pointed to the existence of three areas with bird communities typically found within the state: the Semideciduous Tropical Forest, the Tropical Rainforest and the junction of Grassland and Araucaria Moist Forest. We used rarefaction to measure sampling sufficiency, and found that rarefaction curves reached stabilization for all vegetation types except in Savanna. We observed differences in the level of knowledge of bird biodiversity among the microregions of the state, but including CS data, these differences were mitigated. The same effect was observed in other exploratory analyzes conducted here, emphasizing the fundamental importance of including CS data in macroecological studies. Production of easily accessible data and its unrestricted availability makes CS a very important tool, especially in highly diverse regions as the Neotropics, as it can offer a more accurate picture of bird composition in comparison to the exclusive use of traditional scientific references.},

Destas, onze s{\~{a}}o end{\^{e}}micas do Estado de S{\~{a}}o Paulo (Mesoclemmys cf. vanderhaegei, Amphisbaena sanctaeritae, Mabuya caissara, Mabuya macrorhyncha, Liotyphlops caissara, Liotyphlops schubarti, Corallus cropanii, Atractus serranus, Phalotris lativittatus, Bothropoides alcatraz, Bothropoides insularis). Entre os Squamata, quatro lagartos e uma serpente correspondem a esp{\'{e}}cies ainda n{\~{a}}o descritas.

A riqueza de r{\'{e}}pteis atualmente registrada no Estado de S{\~{a}}o Paulo representa cerca de 30{\%} da riqueza conhecida para o grupo em todo o territ{\'{o}}rio brasileiro, que abrange 721 esp{\'{e}}cies. Entretanto, conclu{\'{i}}mos que estudos mais detalhados sobre a taxonomia e a distribui{\c{c}}{\~{a}}o de esp{\'{e}}cies bem como os esfor{\c{c}}os de coleta em {\'{a}}reas com lacunas de amostragem devem ainda aumentar o n{\'{u}}mero de esp{\'{e}}cies de r{\'{e}}pteis no estado.The present study provides a list of species of reptiles known to occur in the State of S{\~{a}}o Paulo, based on specimens with confirmed localities, housed in the three largest scientific collections of the state, and published information. We registered the presence of 212 species of reptiles within the boundaries of the state that belong to 23 families and include 12 chelonians, three crocodilians, and 197 squamates (142 snakes, 44 "lizards," and 11 amphisbenians). Eleven species are endemic to the State of S{\~{a}}o Paulo (Mesoclemmys cf. vanderhaegei, Amphisbaena sanctaeritae, Mabuya caissara, Mabuya macrorhyncha, Liotyphlops caissara, Liotyphlops schubarti, Corallus cropanii, Atractus serranus, Phalotris lativittatus, Bothropoides alcatraz, Bothropoides insularis). Within Squamata, four lizards and one snake correspond to valid species that are still in need of formal description. Thirty-two species are included in the List of Threatened Species from the State of S{\~{a}}o Paulo, while only nine belong to the Brazilian List of Threatened Species. Reptile species richness for the state represents already approximately 30{\%} of species richness known to occur in all the Brazilian territory, which includes 721 species. However, we conclude that more detailed taxonomic and distributional studies as well as more surveys targeting poorly known localities will have the effect of augmenting the number of species for the state.},

@book{McCabe1974,
abstract = {This is a one- or  two-semester text intended to provide students in many  academie disciplines with an intuitive, yet sound introduction to statistics. The first chapter presents a short overvienw of the subject, in which the basic terminology is introduced and some of the principal problems are identified. I have tried to emphasize the importance of statistical inference in this initial chapter and as the book develops. The development itself, in subsequent chapters, is built on the basic concepts of sample space, probability measure, and random variable. Topics include discrete and continuous probabiliy, random variables and distributions, descriptive statistics, sampling, simulation, estimation, hypothesis testing, regression and correlation. The book began with the belief that computers can be introfuced into a pre-calculs statistics course, in such a way as to complement and enhance, rather than impose upon, the statistical development. This belief was reinforced through my participation in two workshops on the instructional use of computers in statistics. These workshops were sponsored by the University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill, in the summers of 1969 and 1970, and were supported by the National Science Foundation (Grant N° GJ-306). Due in part to these workshops, I found myself  teaching introductory statistics courses using notes that eventually evolved into this book. What really convinced me of the feasibility of the "computer approach" was the enthusiastic response and gratifying performance of the students in these courses.},

abstract = {Citizen-science (CS) programs provide a cost-effective way to collect monitoring data over large temporal and spatial scales. Despite the recent proliferation of these programs, some in the conservation and management community remain skeptical about the quality of information generated, in part because of the lack of a rigorous framework for program evaluation. Drawing from the CS literature, we developed a structured rubric to guide the evaluation of CS programs. We test the utility of the rubric by conducting an internal and external review of a case-study CS program. The case study demonstrates the importance of the evaluation process and the effectiveness of the rubric to identify program elements that needed improvement. Our results support the assertion that program evaluation using a structured rubric can help CS programs meet their objectives, promote CS data usage in conservation and management, and maximize CS return on investment.},

abstract = {Because of a range of constraints, the availability of biodiversity-related information varies considerably over space, time, taxa, and types of data, thereby causing gaps in knowledge. Despite growing awareness of this issue among scientists, it is still poorly known how - and whether - scientific efforts have contributed to overcoming these information gaps. Focusing on spatial gaps in global biodiversity data, we show that the accumulation rates of nonbird species occurrence records stored in the Global Biodiversity Information Facility have not improved - and have even potentially declined - over the past three decades in data-poor, often biodiversity-rich regions. Meanwhile, one citizen-science project, eBird, has been making a considerable contribution to the collection and sharing of bird records, even in the data-poorest countries, and is accelerating the accumulation of bird records globally. We discuss the potentials and limitations of citizen-science projects for tackling gaps in biodiversity information, particularly from the perspective of biodiversity conservation.},

abstract = {Over the past 20 years, thousands of citizen science projects engaging millions of participants in collecting and/or processing data have sprung up around the world. Here we review documented outcomes from four categories of citizen science projects which are defined by the nature of the activities in which their participants engage – Data Collection, Data Processing, Curriculum-based, and Community Science. We find strong evidence that scientific outcomes of citizen science are well documented, particularly for Data Collection and Data Processing projects. We find limited but growing evidence that citizen science projects achieve participant gains in knowledge about science knowledge and process, increase public awareness of the diversity of scientific research, and provide deeper meaning to participants' hobbies. We also find some evidence that citizen science can contribute positively to social well-being by influencing the questions that are being addressed and by giving people a voice in local environmental decision making. While not all citizen science projects are intended to achieve a greater degree of public understanding of science, social change, or improved science -society relationships, those projects that do require effort and resources in four main categories: (1) project design, (2) outcomes measurement, (3) engagement of new audiences, and (4) new directions for research.},

abstract = {The currently best-known ornithological citizen-science platform is Cornell's eBird, which provides crucial information for bird migration studies. Considering the solid validity of eBird data, and after a validation process, we comparatively explored the data available in the Brazilian-wide platform WikiAves for bird migration studies. We selected five migratory and four resident species as models, controlling for likely sampling biases derived from efforts by the platform collaborators. If data in WikiAves were adequate for migration studies, we respectively expected, after a between-platform comparison, similar yearlong seasonal and non-seasonal occurrence records of all migratory and resident species. Data analysis supported our expectations: eBird and WikiAves data showed consistent temporal occurrence patterns for all evaluated species. Therefore, we selected another six model-species showing literature inconsistency on their migratory behaviour, demonstrating for the first time the potential of a Brazilian citizen-science database–WikiAves–in unveiling geographically seasonal occurrence patterns of the understudied migratory bird species in Brazil. Our study highlights the general public relevance on reducing knowledge gaps about bird migration in Brazil, revealing a feasible strategy to overcome some current logistic barriers that preclude advances in South American bird migration studies, a currently underexplored research area, especially by Brazilian researchers.},

abstract = {Collaborative research by networks of amateurs has had a major role in ornithology and conservation science and will continue to do so. It has been important in establishing the facts of migration, systematically recording distribution, providing insights into habitat requirements and recording variation in numbers, productivity and survival, thus allowing detailed demographic analyses. The availability of these data has allowed conservation work to be focussed on priority species, habitats and sites and enabled refined monitoring and research programmes aimed at providing the understanding necessary for sound conservation management and for evidence-based government policy. The success of such work depends on the independence of the science from those advocating particular policies in order to ensure that the science is unbiased. Wetland birds are surveyed in much of the world. Most countries also have a ringing scheme. Other forms of collaborative ornithology are strong in North America, Australia and Australasia, more patchily distributed in Asia (but with strong growth in some countries) and even patchier in Africa and South America. Such work is most successful where there is a strong partnership between the amateurs and the professional, based on their complementary roles. The participation of large numbers of volunteers not only enables work to be done that would otherwise be impossible but also facilitates democratic participation in the decisions made by society and builds social capital. The recruitment to and subsequent retention of people in the research networks are important skills. Surveys must be organized in ways that take into account the motives of the participants. It is useful to assess the skills of potential participants and, rather than rejecting those thought not to have adequate skills, to provide training. Special attention needs to be paid to ensuring that instructions are clear, that methods are standardized and that data are gathered in a form that is easily processed. Providing for the continuity of long-term projects is essential. There are advantages to having just one organization running most of the work in each country. Various sorts of organizations are possible: societies governed by their (amateur) members but employing professional staff to organize the work seem to be a particularly successful model. Independence from government and from conservation organizations is desirable. {\textcopyright} Dt. Ornithologen-Gesellschaft e.V. 2007.},

abstract = {1. Knowledge of species diversity across a landscape is essential for answering ecological questions and developing conservation and management goals and protocols. However, data on species occurrence are often limited, with the consequence that species lists are incomplete. 2. As a means to develop a complete species occurrence list for an urbanizing landscape in south-eastern Michigan, USA, all bird species accounts from four public and private organizations were integrated, and all officially documented rare birds added. A citizen science approach was then used to develop an independent species list from c. 1700 landowner surveys. 3. The specific goals of the research were to: (i) develop a complete list of species occurrence across a landscape; (ii) ascertain what percentage of the total species pool landowners could collectively identify; (iii) identify species that had not been noted in the census data sets but could be corroborated; (iv) compare the percentage overlap among different bird censuses; and (v) assess the potential value of casual (i.e. citizen science) records to bird distribution studies. 4. The resulting list comprised 318 individual bird species, which was 8{\textperiodcentered}5{\%} greater than any of the individual lists. Landowners identified 171 bird species (c. 54{\%}) and had {\textgreater} 50{\%} overlap with all existing databases. In addition, landowners identified 10 species noted only in a single database of rare or vagrant species. The percentage overlap of species across the five different lists ranged from 35{\%} to 66{\%}, with the differences stemming largely from different protocols. Subsetting the data for one county within the landscape reduced the unique species to 294, which was approximately equivalent to the existing county species list. 5. Synthesis and applications. The findings highlight the value of surveying private landowners as a means of detecting species presence/absence in numerous inaccessible locations, and the important role landowners can play in providing species occurrence information. Similarly, the results indicate the need to use multiple data sources for establishing a list of potential species occurrence for the conservation and management of biological resources. {\textcopyright} 2005 British Ecological Society.},

abstract = {Determining population trends is critical for conservation. For most bird species, trends are based on count data gathered by institutions with formalized survey protocols. However, limited resources may prevent these types of surveys, especially in developing countries. Ecotourism growth and subsequent increases in opportunistic data from birdwatching can provide a source of population trend information if analyses control for inter-observer variation. List length analysis (LLA) controls for such variation by using the number of species recorded as a proxy for observer skill and effort. Here, we use LLA on opportunistic data gathered by eBird to estimate population trends for 574 North American bird species (48{\%} of species declining) and compare these estimates to population trends based on 1) formal breeding bird surveys (54{\%} of species declining) and 2) population estimates from eBird data controlled using more rigorous correction (46{\%} of species declining). Our analyses show that eBird data produce population trends that differ on average by only 0.4{\%}/year from formal surveys and do not differ significantly from estimates using more control metrics. We find that estimates do not improve appreciably beyond 10,000 checklists, suggesting this as the minimum threshold of opportunistic data required for population trend estimation. Lastly, we show that characteristics affecting a species' ubiquity, such as geographic and elevational range, can affect its population trend estimate. Our results suggest that opportunistic data can be used to approximate species population trends, especially for widespread species. Because our protocol uses information present in all checklists, it can be applied to a diversity of data sources including eBird, trip reports, and bird atlases.},

abstract = {Predicting the binding mode of flexible polypeptides to proteins is an important task that falls outside the domain of applicability of most small molecule and protein−protein docking tools. Here, we test the small molecule flexible ligand docking program Glide on a set of 19 non-$\alpha$-helical peptides and systematically improve pose prediction accuracy by enhancing Glide sampling for flexible polypeptides. In addition, scoring of the poses was improved by post-processing with physics-based implicit solvent MM- GBSA calculations. Using the best RMSD among the top 10 scoring poses as a metric, the success rate (RMSD ≤ 2.0 {\AA} for the interface backbone atoms) increased from 21{\%} with default Glide SP settings to 58{\%} with the enhanced peptide sampling and scoring protocol in the case of redocking to the native protein structure. This approaches the accuracy of the recently developed Rosetta FlexPepDock method (63{\%} success for these 19 peptides) while being over 100 times faster. Cross-docking was performed for a subset of cases where an unbound receptor structure was available, and in that case, 40{\%} of peptides were docked successfully. We analyze the results and find that the optimized polypeptide protocol is most accurate for extended peptides of limited size and number of formal charges, defining a domain of applicability for this approach.},

abstract = {Concerns about pollinator declines have grown in recent years, yet the ability to detect changes in abundance, taxonomic richness, and composition of pollinator communities is hampered severely by the lack of data over space and time. Citizen scientists may be able to extend the spatial and temporal extent of pollinator monitoring programs. We developed a citizen-science monitoring protocol in which we trained 13 citizen scientists to observe and classify floral visitors at the resolution of orders or super families (e.g., bee, wasp, fly) and at finer resolution within bees (superfamily Apoidea) only. We evaluated the protocol by comparing data collected simultaneously at 17 sites by citizen scientists (observational data set) and by professionals (specimen-based data set). The sites differed with respect to the presence and age of hedgerows planted to improve habitat quality for pollinators. We found significant, positive correlations among the two data sets for higher level taxonomic composition, honey bee (Apis mellifera) abundance, non-Apis bee abundance, bee richness, and bee community similarity. Results for both data sets also showed similar trends (or lack thereof) in these metrics among sites differing in the presence and age of hedgerows. Nevertheless, citizen scientists did not observe approximately half of the bee groups collected by professional scientists at the same sites. Thus, the utility of citizen-science observational data may be restricted to detection of community-level changes in abundance, richness, or similarity over space and time, and citizen-science observations may not reliably reflect the abundance or frequency of occurrence of specific pollinator species or groups. {\textcopyright}2011 Society for Conservation Biology.},
