A pr{\'{a}}tica da observa{\c{c}}{\~{a}}o de aves como forma de la zer tornou-se popular entre os brasileiros a partir da primeira d{\'{e}}cada do s{\'{e}}culo XXI , sendo que atualmente os observadores brasileiros j{\'{a}} possuem o comportamento de compartilhar seus registros ornitol{\'{o}}gicos em plataformas online de ci{\^{e}}ncia cidad{\~{a}} . Boa parte destes observadores reside no estado de S{\~{a}}o Paulo , mas at{\'{e}} ent{\~{a}}o n{\~{a}}o se tinha ideia sobre quais locais no estado j{\'{a}} foram alvo deste p{\'{u}}blico. Dessa forma , o presente estudo traz uma extensa compila{\c{c}}{\~{a}}o das localidades do estado visitadas por observadores de aves , obtidas a partir da revis{\~{a}}o dos registros ornitol{\'{o}}gicos depositados nas tr{\^{e}}s principais pla - taformas online que promovem ci{\^{e}}ncia cidad{\~{a}} no Brasil (WikiAves , T{\'{a}}xeus e eBird).

abstract = {Because of a range of constraints, the availability of biodiversity-related information varies considerably over space, time, taxa, and types of data, thereby causing gaps in knowledge. Despite growing awareness of this issue among scientists, it is still poorly known how - and whether - scientific efforts have contributed to overcoming these information gaps. Focusing on spatial gaps in global biodiversity data, we show that the accumulation rates of nonbird species occurrence records stored in the Global Biodiversity Information Facility have not improved - and have even potentially declined - over the past three decades in data-poor, often biodiversity-rich regions. Meanwhile, one citizen-science project, eBird, has been making a considerable contribution to the collection and sharing of bird records, even in the data-poorest countries, and is accelerating the accumulation of bird records globally. We discuss the potentials and limitations of citizen-science projects for tackling gaps in biodiversity information, particularly from the perspective of biodiversity conservation.},

Citizen science projects have been remarkably successful in advancing scientific knowledge, and contributions from citizen scientists now provide a vast quantity of data about species occurrence and distribution around the world. Most citizen science projects also strive to help participants learn about the organisms they are observing and to experience the process by which scientific investigations are conducted. Developing and implementing public data-collection projects that yield both scientific and educational outcomes requires significant effort. This article describes the model for building and operating citizen science projects that has evolved at the Cornell Lab of Ornithology over the past two decades. We hope that our model will inform the fields of biodiversity monitoring, biological research, and science education while providing a window into the culture of citizen science. {\textcopyright} 2009 by American Institute of Biological Sciences.

abstract = {Over the past 20 years, thousands of citizen science projects engaging millions of participants in collecting and/or processing data have sprung up around the world. Here we review documented outcomes from four categories of citizen science projects which are defined by the nature of the activities in which their participants engage – Data Collection, Data Processing, Curriculum-based, and Community Science. We find strong evidence that scientific outcomes of citizen science are well documented, particularly for Data Collection and Data Processing projects. We find limited but growing evidence that citizen science projects achieve participant gains in knowledge about science knowledge and process, increase public awareness of the diversity of scientific research, and provide deeper meaning to participants' hobbies. We also find some evidence that citizen science can contribute positively to social well-being by influencing the questions that are being addressed and by giving people a voice in local environmental decision making. While not all citizen science projects are intended to achieve a greater degree of public understanding of science, social change, or improved science -society relationships, those projects that do require effort and resources in four main categories: (1) project design, (2) outcomes measurement, (3) engagement of new audiences, and (4) new directions for research.},

abstract = {Predicting the binding mode of flexible polypeptides to proteins is an important task that falls outside the domain of applicability of most small molecule and protein−protein docking tools. Here, we test the small molecule flexible ligand docking program Glide on a set of 19 non-$\alpha$-helical peptides and systematically improve pose prediction accuracy by enhancing Glide sampling for flexible polypeptides. In addition, scoring of the poses was improved by post-processing with physics-based implicit solvent MM- GBSA calculations. Using the best RMSD among the top 10 scoring poses as a metric, the success rate (RMSD ≤ 2.0 {\AA} for the interface backbone atoms) increased from 21{\%} with default Glide SP settings to 58{\%} with the enhanced peptide sampling and scoring protocol in the case of redocking to the native protein structure. This approaches the accuracy of the recently developed Rosetta FlexPepDock method (63{\%} success for these 19 peptides) while being over 100 times faster. Cross-docking was performed for a subset of cases where an unbound receptor structure was available, and in that case, 40{\%} of peptides were docked successfully. We analyze the results and find that the optimized polypeptide protocol is most accurate for extended peptides of limited size and number of formal charges, defining a domain of applicability for this approach.},

abstract = {One of the world's largest citizen science projects is eBird, a database that has been used primarily to address questions of bird distributions and abundance over large spatial scales. However, addressing finer-scale questions is also possible, depending on survey coverage and whether assumptions and limitations are matched to the scale of inferences. Our objective was to determine if the eBird database could be used to develop estimates of bird abundance and diversity comparable to those from standardized shorebird surveys. We compared a year of standardized shorebird surveys by trained observers at Snook Islands Natural Area located in Palm Beach County, Florida, to a year of eBird observations from the same site. Total species richness derived from eBird (25 species) was higher than that from standardized surveys (20 species). Similarly, we found the Shannon diversity index calculated from eBird was higher (2.81) than the same index calculated from standardized surveys (2.21; P {\textless} 0.001). The higher diversity and species richness may reflect the greater effort of eBird participants (35,289 person-hours) compared to our standard surveys (2126 person-hours). We found only a slight difference in parameter estimates between data obtained from eBird and from standardized surveys. Potential use and value of eBird as a tool for land managers and conservationists may be greater than currently realized, but studies conducted in a wider range of ecosystems and locations are needed to develop generalizations.},

Herein, we present a completely new and annotated version of our checklist. For the first time, we list all bird subspecies known from Brazil that are currently accepted by at least one key ornithological reference work. The inclusion of the subspecies should be seen as a synthesis, and not as a taxonomic endorsement. As such, we include in the new checklist 1919 avian species, 910 of which are treated as polytypic in reference works (2042 subspecies), totaling 3051 taxa at the species and subspecies level. We anticipate that several of the subspecies included in our list may be subject to future taxonomic upgrades to species status, while others will probably be shown to be invalid in the light of future taxonomic studies. The results highlight Brazil as a megadiverse country and reinforce the need for proper enforcement of political tools, laws and international commitments assumed by the country to preserve its biodiversity.},

abstract = {Four different types of fuel blends containing demolition and construction wood and household waste were combusted in a small-scale experimental set-up to study the effect of fuel composition on the emissions of polychlorinated dibenzo-p-dioxins (PCDDs), dibenzofurans (PCDFs), biphenyls (PCBs), chlorobenzenes (PCBzs), chlorophenols (PCPhs) and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs). Two woody materials, commercial stemwood (ST) and demolition and construction wood (DC) were selected because of the differences in their persistent organic pollutants (POPs), ash and metals content. For household waste, we used a municipal solid waste (MSW) and a refuse-derived fuel (RDF) from MSW with 5–20 wt{\%} and up to 5 wt{\%} food waste content respectively. No clear effect on the formation of pollutants was observed with different food waste content in the fuel blends tested. Combustion of ST-based fuels was very inefficient which led to high PAH emissions (32 ± 3.8 mg/kgfuel). The use of DC clearly increased the total PCDD and PCDF emissions (71 ± 26 $\mu$g/kgfuel) and had a clear effect on the formation of toxic congeners (210 ± 87 ng WHO2005-TEQ/kgfuel). The high PCDD and PCDF emissions from DC-based fuels can be attributed to the presence of material contaminants such as small pieces of metals or plastics as well as timber treated with chromated copper arsenate preservatives and pentachlorophenol in the DC source.},

abstract = {Collaborative research by networks of amateurs has had a major role in ornithology and conservation science and will continue to do so. It has been important in establishing the facts of migration, systematically recording distribution, providing insights into habitat requirements and recording variation in numbers, productivity and survival, thus allowing detailed demographic analyses. The availability of these data has allowed conservation work to be focussed on priority species, habitats and sites and enabled refined monitoring and research programmes aimed at providing the understanding necessary for sound conservation management and for evidence-based government policy. The success of such work depends on the independence of the science from those advocating particular policies in order to ensure that the science is unbiased. Wetland birds are surveyed in much of the world. Most countries also have a ringing scheme. Other forms of collaborative ornithology are strong in North America, Australia and Australasia, more patchily distributed in Asia (but with strong growth in some countries) and even patchier in Africa and South America. Such work is most successful where there is a strong partnership between the amateurs and the professional, based on their complementary roles. The participation of large numbers of volunteers not only enables work to be done that would otherwise be impossible but also facilitates democratic participation in the decisions made by society and builds social capital. The recruitment to and subsequent retention of people in the research networks are important skills. Surveys must be organized in ways that take into account the motives of the participants. It is useful to assess the skills of potential participants and, rather than rejecting those thought not to have adequate skills, to provide training. Special attention needs to be paid to ensuring that instructions are clear, that methods are standardized and that data are gathered in a form that is easily processed. Providing for the continuity of long-term projects is essential. There are advantages to having just one organization running most of the work in each country. Various sorts of organizations are possible: societies governed by their (amateur) members but employing professional staff to organize the work seem to be a particularly successful model. Independence from government and from conservation organizations is desirable. {\textcopyright} Dt. Ornithologen-Gesellschaft e.V. 2007.},

abstract = {Data generated by citizen science is particularly valuable in ecological research. If used discerningly with data from traditional scientific references, citizen science can directly contribute to biogeography knowledge and conservation policies by increasing the number of species records in large geographic areas. Considering the current level of knowledge on south Brazilian avifauna, the large volume of data produced by uncoordinated citizen science effort (CS), and the growing need for information on changes in abundance and species composition, we have compiled an updated, general list of bird species occurrence within the state of Parana. We have listed extinct, invasive and recently-colonizing species as well as indicator species of the state's vegetation types. We further assess the degree of knowledge of different regions within the state based on data from traditional scientific references, and the effect of including CS data in the same analysis. We have compiled data on 766 bird species, based on 70, 346 individual records from traditional scientific references, and 79, 468 from CS. Extinct and invasive species were identified by comparing their occurrence and abundance over a series of three time periods. Indicator species analysis pointed to the existence of three areas with bird communities typically found within the state: the Semideciduous Tropical Forest, the Tropical Rainforest and the junction of Grassland and Araucaria Moist Forest. We used rarefaction to measure sampling sufficiency, and found that rarefaction curves reached stabilization for all vegetation types except in Savanna. We observed differences in the level of knowledge of bird biodiversity among the microregions of the state, but including CS data, these differences were mitigated. The same effect was observed in other exploratory analyzes conducted here, emphasizing the fundamental importance of including CS data in macroecological studies. Production of easily accessible data and its unrestricted availability makes CS a very important tool, especially in highly diverse regions as the Neotropics, as it can offer a more accurate picture of bird composition in comparison to the exclusive use of traditional scientific references.},

abstract = {Context: The concept of citizen science (CS) is currently referred to by many actors inside and outside science and research. Several descriptions of this purportedly new approach of science are often heard in connection with large datasets and the possibilities of mobilizing crowds outside science to assists with observations and classifications. However, other accounts refer to CS as a way of democratizing science, aiding concerned communities in creating data to influence policy and as a way of promoting political decision processes involving environment and health. Objective: In this study we analyse two datasets (N = 1935, N = 633) retrieved from the Web of Science (WoS) with the aim of giving a scientometric description of what the concept of CS entails. We account for its development over time, and what strands of research that has adopted CS and give an assessment of what scientific output has been achieved in CS-related projects. To attain this, scientometric methods have been combined with qualitative approaches to render more precise search terms. Results: Results indicate that there are three main focal points of CS. The largest is composed of research on biology, conservation and ecology, and utilizes CS mainly as a methodology of collecting and classifying data. A second strand of research has emerged through geographic information research, where citizens participate in the collection of geographic data. Thirdly, there is a line of research relating to the social sciences and epidemiology, which studies and facilitates public participation in relation to environmental issues and health. In terms of scientific output, the largest body of articles are to be found in biology and conservation research. In absolute numbers, the amount of publications generated by CS is low (N = 1935), but over the past decade a new and very productive line of CS based on digital platforms has emerged for the collection and classification of data.},

abstract = {1. Knowledge of species diversity across a landscape is essential for answering ecological questions and developing conservation and management goals and protocols. However, data on species occurrence are often limited, with the consequence that species lists are incomplete. 2. As a means to develop a complete species occurrence list for an urbanizing landscape in south-eastern Michigan, USA, all bird species accounts from four public and private organizations were integrated, and all officially documented rare birds added. A citizen science approach was then used to develop an independent species list from c. 1700 landowner surveys. 3. The specific goals of the research were to: (i) develop a complete list of species occurrence across a landscape; (ii) ascertain what percentage of the total species pool landowners could collectively identify; (iii) identify species that had not been noted in the census data sets but could be corroborated; (iv) compare the percentage overlap among different bird censuses; and (v) assess the potential value of casual (i.e. citizen science) records to bird distribution studies. 4. The resulting list comprised 318 individual bird species, which was 8{\textperiodcentered}5{\%} greater than any of the individual lists. Landowners identified 171 bird species (c. 54{\%}) and had {\textgreater} 50{\%} overlap with all existing databases. In addition, landowners identified 10 species noted only in a single database of rare or vagrant species. The percentage overlap of species across the five different lists ranged from 35{\%} to 66{\%}, with the differences stemming largely from different protocols. Subsetting the data for one county within the landscape reduced the unique species to 294, which was approximately equivalent to the existing county species list. 5. Synthesis and applications. The findings highlight the value of surveying private landowners as a means of detecting species presence/absence in numerous inaccessible locations, and the important role landowners can play in providing species occurrence information. Similarly, the results indicate the need to use multiple data sources for establishing a list of potential species occurrence for the conservation and management of biological resources. {\textcopyright} 2005 British Ecological Society.},

abstract = {This is a one- or  two-semester text intended to provide students in many  academie disciplines with an intuitive, yet sound introduction to statistics. The first chapter presents a short overvienw of the subject, in which the basic terminology is introduced and some of the principal problems are identified. I have tried to emphasize the importance of statistical inference in this initial chapter and as the book develops. The development itself, in subsequent chapters, is built on the basic concepts of sample space, probability measure, and random variable. Topics include discrete and continuous probabiliy, random variables and distributions, descriptive statistics, sampling, simulation, estimation, hypothesis testing, regression and correlation. The book began with the belief that computers can be introfuced into a pre-calculs statistics course, in such a way as to complement and enhance, rather than impose upon, the statistical development. This belief was reinforced through my participation in two workshops on the instructional use of computers in statistics. These workshops were sponsored by the University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill, in the summers of 1969 and 1970, and were supported by the National Science Foundation (Grant N° GJ-306). Due in part to these workshops, I found myself  teaching introductory statistics courses using notes that eventually evolved into this book. What really convinced me of the feasibility of the "computer approach" was the enthusiastic response and gratifying performance of the students in these courses.},

abstract = {The currently best-known ornithological citizen-science platform is Cornell's eBird, which provides crucial information for bird migration studies. Considering the solid validity of eBird data, and after a validation process, we comparatively explored the data available in the Brazilian-wide platform WikiAves for bird migration studies. We selected five migratory and four resident species as models, controlling for likely sampling biases derived from efforts by the platform collaborators. If data in WikiAves were adequate for migration studies, we respectively expected, after a between-platform comparison, similar yearlong seasonal and non-seasonal occurrence records of all migratory and resident species. Data analysis supported our expectations: eBird and WikiAves data showed consistent temporal occurrence patterns for all evaluated species. Therefore, we selected another six model-species showing literature inconsistency on their migratory behaviour, demonstrating for the first time the potential of a Brazilian citizen-science database–WikiAves–in unveiling geographically seasonal occurrence patterns of the understudied migratory bird species in Brazil. Our study highlights the general public relevance on reducing knowledge gaps about bird migration in Brazil, revealing a feasible strategy to overcome some current logistic barriers that preclude advances in South American bird migration studies, a currently underexplored research area, especially by Brazilian researchers.},

Based on data compiled by CEO (Centro de Estudos Ornitol{\'{o}}gicos), Willis and Oniki (2003), and from a search of more than 50 theses, dissertations, monographs and technical works, we listed all bird species recorded in the State of S{\~{a}}o Paulo. These records are composed of skins and other evidence collected and deposited in collections, and on photographs and voice samples. A total of 793 species were registered, distributed in 25 orders and 85 families, and corresponding to 45{\%} of the Brazilian avifauna. Reasons for this high diversity are related to the environmental diversity found in the state, influenced by altitudinal and geographical ranges, different phytophysiognomies, presence of a coastal region, and areas of contact between forest ecosystems and Cerrado. Results of the Biota project contributed to a better understanding of how birds respond to anthropogenic alterations of the environment, such as habitat fragmentation. The main ornithological research groups are still based in universities and museums. Deficiencies of knowledge concerning bird studies in S{\~{a}}o Paulo are related to the lack of standardization of survey methodologies; paucity in the monitoring of threatened species in the long term; restricted knowledge about species capacity to use matrix; and lack of refinement in the delimitation of evolutionary units and their distribution, which is essential for species reintroduction in regions where they have gone extinct.},

abstract = {Citizen-science projects engage volunteers to gather or process data to address scientific questions. But citizen-science projects vary in their ability to contribute usefully for science, conservation, or public policy. eBird has evolved from a basic citizen-science project into a collective enterprise, taking a novel approach to citizen science by developing cooperative partnerships among experts in a wide range of fields: population and distributions, conservation biologists, quantitative ecologists, statisticians, computer scientists, GIS and informatics specialists, application developers, and data administrators. The goal is to increase data quantity through participant recruitment and engagement, but also to quantify and control for data quality issues such as observer variability, imperfect detection of species, and both spatial and temporal bias in data collection. Advances at the interface among ecology, statistics, and computer science allow us to create new species distribution models that provide accurate estimates across broad spatial and temporal scales with extremely detailed resolution. eBird data are openly available and used by a broad spectrum of students, teachers, scientists, NGOs, government agencies, land managers, and policy makers. Feedback from this broad data use community helps identify development priorities. As a result, eBird has become a major source of biodiversity data, increasing our knowledge of the dynamics of species distributions, and having a direct impact on the conservation of birds and their habitats. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {Citizen-science (CS) programs provide a cost-effective way to collect monitoring data over large temporal and spatial scales. Despite the recent proliferation of these programs, some in the conservation and management community remain skeptical about the quality of information generated, in part because of the lack of a rigorous framework for program evaluation. Drawing from the CS literature, we developed a structured rubric to guide the evaluation of CS programs. We test the utility of the rubric by conducting an internal and external review of a case-study CS program. The case study demonstrates the importance of the evaluation process and the effectiveness of the rubric to identify program elements that needed improvement. Our results support the assertion that program evaluation using a structured rubric can help CS programs meet their objectives, promote CS data usage in conservation and management, and maximize CS return on investment.},

abstract = {Predicting the binding mode of flexible polypeptides to proteins is an important task that falls outside the domain of applicability of most small molecule and protein−protein docking tools. Here, we test the small molecule flexible ligand docking program Glide on a set of 19 non-$\alpha$-helical peptides and systematically improve pose prediction accuracy by enhancing Glide sampling for flexible polypeptides. In addition, scoring of the poses was improved by post-processing with physics-based implicit solvent MM- GBSA calculations. Using the best RMSD among the top 10 scoring poses as a metric, the success rate (RMSD ≤ 2.0 {\AA} for the interface backbone atoms) increased from 21{\%} with default Glide SP settings to 58{\%} with the enhanced peptide sampling and scoring protocol in the case of redocking to the native protein structure. This approaches the accuracy of the recently developed Rosetta FlexPepDock method (63{\%} success for these 19 peptides) while being over 100 times faster. Cross-docking was performed for a subset of cases where an unbound receptor structure was available, and in that case, 40{\%} of peptides were docked successfully. We analyze the results and find that the optimized polypeptide protocol is most accurate for extended peptides of limited size and number of formal charges, defining a domain of applicability for this approach.},

Thirty-two species are included in the List of Threatened Species from the State of S{\~{a}}o Paulo, while only nine belong to the Brazilian List of Threatened Species. Reptile species richness for the state represents already approximately 30{\%} of species richness known to occur in all the Brazilian territory, which includes 721 species. However, we conclude that more detailed taxonomic and distributional studies as well as more surveys targeting poorly known localities will have the effect of augmenting the number of species for the state.},
